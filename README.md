# JpegXs.Net


**JpegXS.Net** is a .NET library for encoding and decoding images using the JPEG XS format. It provides high-performance and low-latency image compression, making it ideal for real-time applications such as video streaming and professional imaging workflows.

## Features

- **JPEG XS Encoding** – Convert images to JPEG XS format efficiently.
- **JPEG XS Decoding** – Load and process JPEG XS images seamlessly.
- **Optimized Performance** – Designed for high-speed encoding and decoding with minimal latency.
- **.NET Integration** – Easily use in .NET applications
- **Wrapper Around SVT-JPEG-XS** – Integrates the SVT-JPEG-XS library for enhanced encoding and decoding performance.

## SVT-JPEG-XS Integration

JpegXS.Net serves as a .NET wrapper around the [SVT-JPEG-XS](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/SVT-JPEG-XS) library, developed by OpenVisualCloud. SVT-JPEG-XS provides scalable and highly optimized encoding and decoding capabilities, ensuring efficient image compression with ultra-low latency.

## Current Status

**?? **Under Development** ?? **
JpegXS.Net is still a work in progress, with ongoing improvements to expand format support and enhance performance. Currently, only **RGB24 format** is supported for encoding and decoding. Future updates will introduce additional pixel formats, improved error handling, and broader compatibility.
